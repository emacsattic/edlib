* Takes care to allow your kill-ring to be unmodified.  See
edlib-add-to-kill-ring-p. 

   New in 1.8.0alpha:
* Will now accept a list of different copyright-holders.. 


	New in version 1.4
* Fixed a bug in edlib-update-archive-entry.

	New in version 1.2
* Further improved edlib-doc, improved user-interface, enhanced
  rendering of documentation-strings, including conversion of \( or \)
  to \\\( or \\\) when necessary, and if the user so desires.


	New in version 1.0

* VASTLY improved user-interface, and everything else.
* Complete checkdoc compliance.

;;; Introduction:

;; as introduction
(defvar edlib-introduction
 "EDLIB helps you EDit emacs-lisp LIBraries:

* Creates and updates your emacs-lisp archive entry and other
  library-paraphernalia for you..  updates version info in the
  elisp-archive-header-info based on <lib>-version..

* Allows you to use one source for <library>-Introduction. When you
  want to post code to gnu.emacs.sources :\) , type M-x
  <lib>-introduction, and then cut and paste.. the same introduction
  that you posted to gnu.emacs.sources is also available to users by
  either typing <lib>-introduction or visiting your source-file.

* Does the same thing for New-Features, as well as for Commentary.
  Allows intro and commentary be accessible both from file and a
  function.

* Allow easy editing of doc-strings... editing them as the user would
  see it, so no need to type \\\" when you need \".. and moreover, in the
  text-mode, not emacs-lisp-mode , that's how i am editing this
  one.. to do so, go to the relevant doc-string and type M-x edlib-doc


* It also helps you post them to gnu.emacs.sources, it extracts the
  information from <lib>-introduction and presents that as
  introduction to the package. M-x edlib-post-source.


* While doing everything, it lets you have complete control, it does
  nothing without asking you.

* As of 8/3/01, defines macro called edlib-read-string

* Features and patches welcome :\)")

;;; Commentary:
(defvar edlib-commentary
 "
Type M-x edlib-introduction for intro, and read it. Then, read this:

To take full advantage of edlib, Don't forget to see the documentation
for edlib-update-version-info and thus update your
write-file-hook. And don't forget to define <lib>-version somewhere
for your <lib>.

Also, see edlib.el and add the very few suggested  global-set-keys to your
.emacs..

Main Functions to use:
Write some code and call 'edlib on it. 
Can also use sub-functions like edlib-insert-archive-entry...

To edit \(documentation-\)strings, use edlib-doc on the documentation,
this allows you to easily format your documentation, since everything
is done in text-mode.

I am thus now in the process of using this package to convert all my
existing packages to this form..  remove all source-code commented-out
commentaries and define them in M-x <lib>-commentary..  One thing that
needs is uncommenting some code.. and my emacs-20.3.1's comment-region
is terrible at uncommenting more than one comment.. So, also check out
'edlib-uncomment-region.

Customizations:
i should add more of them.  any suggestions/patches very welcome!
i would like edlib to capture most authors' styles, yet still maintain
some automations.. like automatic version-updates..

For now, these are the variables you can change \(in yr .emacs\):

edlib-name-function:
				bind it to a function of your choice
				that determines the name of the
				package based on the name of the
				buffer etc. See also the default..

edlib-author-name/email		you the author

edlib-home-page:		for latest versions.

edlib-license-string:		your preferred license  etc.

edlib-annoying-doc-string:	your default edlib-documentations..

edlib-filename-or-package:
				default = both, so you can delete the
				one you do not like

NOTE:
edlib-name, edlib-found-forward, edlib-found-backward: *NOT*
	    customizable.. any changes you make will be rendered
	    ineffective..

Do not confuse edlib-home-page, your homepage, with <lib>-home-page,
that is the page leading to the latest version of your library.  Of
course, you may choose to have them be the same.. <lib>-home-page
defaults to your page, but you can change it.. If you do change it
inside the defvar, don't forget that it has no effect unless you first
undefine the variable..

\(the only place the 2 variables have the same name is edlib itself!\)

should be platform independent, but Tested on emacs20.3 and now on
emacs21 on a sun sparc station/unix...

Requires 'thingatpt which comes with Emacs..
If you are found to be not present at a string, this function simply
does nothing.  Do NOT start more than one `edlib-doc' sessions at the
same time..
Caution: If the cursor is right at the ending \" when you invoke
`edlib-doc', it will misjudge the string, as you will be able to
judge from your *edlib* buffer.. DO NOT CONTINUE.. if you go ahead, it
will replace some of your code!!!! with this string...

Can be used to edit *any* strings easily, not just doc-strings."
